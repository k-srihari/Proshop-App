## The Proshop App

This is a fullstack e-commerce application built as an SPA using _React JS_ + _Redux_ + _Node JS_ + _Express JS_ + _Rest API_ + _Mongo DB_

In this application, Users can view available products, add desired products to cart and order them, either by paying through a fake Paypal sandbox API or by opting for cash on delivery during checkout. Once order is placed, they can keep track of it, and any other orders by going to 'Profile' section via the header dropdown.

And, by logging into the application, Admins are able to manage existing users, products and orders. They can edit/delete the existing users/products/orders. Besides, they can also add new products, can mark a cash-on-delivery order as 'paid', and can also mark orders as 'delivered'.

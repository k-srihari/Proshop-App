## The Proshop App

---

This is a fullstack e-commerce application built as an SPA using _React JS_ + _Redux_ + _Node JS_ + _Express JS_ + _Rest API_ + _Mongo DB_

In this application, Users can view available products, add desired to cart and order them, either by paying through a fake Paypal sanbox API or by opting for cash on delivery during checkout. Once order is placed they can keep track of it and any other orders by going to 'My Profile' in the header dropdown.

And by logging into the application, Admins are able to manage existing users, products and orders. They can edit/delete the existing users/products/orders. Besides, they can also add new products, can mark a cash-on-delivery order as 'paid', and can also mark orders as 'delivered'.

To try out the working of this application, please go to this [Heroku](https://google.com) link and login as admin and/or user using the following credentials. And of course, you can register as a new user as well, by clicking on the Register option.

1. **Admin User** email: **admin@xyz.com** password: **123456**
2. **John Doe** email: **john@xyz** password: **123456**
